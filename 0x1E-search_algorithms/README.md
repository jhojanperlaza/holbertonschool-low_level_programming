## What is a search algorithm?
Any algorithm which solves the search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, either with discrete or continuous values.

## Linear or Sequential Search
This algorithm works by sequentially iterating through the whole array or list from one end until the target element is found. If the element is found, it returns its index, else -1.

## Binary Search
This type of searching algorithm is used to find the position of a specific value contained in a sorted array. The binary search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer and it is considered the best searching algorithm because it's faster to run.

## big O notations
* O(1)
* O(n)
* O(n!)
* n*m -> O(nm)
* n square -> O(n^2)
* sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
* log(n) -> O(log(n))
* n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
